# JobShield

JobShield is a web application that empowers job seekers by providing AI-driven insights into job postings, helping them identify potential "ghost jobs" or time-wasting opportunities.

## Project Structure

- `backend/` — Node.js/Express backend (OpenAI + Firestore)
- `JobScans.tsx` — React frontend (single file, for deployment bundle)

## Features
- Paste a job URL or description and get an instant AI-powered scan
- See ghost likelihood, red flags, and actionable recommendations
- Archive of past scans (global, anonymous)
- Outreach message generator

## Backend Setup
See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for full backend setup and deployment instructions.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Set up environment variable:**
   - Create a `.env` file in your frontend root:
     ```
     REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
     ```
   - (See `.env.example` for a template)

2. **Build and deploy:**
   - Use your preferred static site host (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Make sure your backend is deployed and accessible from your frontend

## Sustainability & Best Practices
- All secrets are stored in environment variables
- Backend is rate-limited and CORS-protected
- No user authentication or tracking (privacy-first)
- Open source ready (add a license if desired)
