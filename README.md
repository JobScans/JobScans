Our Journey So Far: Building JobScans
This document chronicles the evolution of the JobScans project, from its initial conception to its current state. It's a story of a mission-driven idea that has been refined through collaboration and a deep focus on the end user: the job seeker.

The Spark: A Job Seeker's Frustration
The project was born from a personal and deeply relatable experience: the frustrating, opaque, and often demoralizing process of applying for jobs. The core problems identified were:

The Black Hole: Sending dozens of applications with little to no response.

The Rise of AI: Dealing with automated hiring processes that lack human nuance.

Deceptive Practices: The discovery of "ghost jobs," unethical data collection, and misleading postings.

The initial goal was clear: to create a defensive tool to aid job seekers, equipping them to combat shady practices and approach their search with more confidence.

The Pivot: From Private Tool to Community Shield
The first version of JobScans was envisioned as a 100% private, on-device tool. The "Archive" was meant to be a personal history of a user's applications, with absolutely no data ever leaving their computer.

However, a crucial insight led to a fundamental pivot. The realization that "we all should empower each other" transformed the project's soul. The mission evolved from purely individual defense to community-powered protection. The "Archive" was reborn as a public, anonymous "wall of shame" for jobs flagged by the community. This decision introduced the need for a backend (Firebase Firestore) but was made with a strict commitment to user anonymity.

Defining the Logic: The "How"
With a clear mission, we defined the non-AI "brains" of the extension. The logic was split into two modes:

Red Flag Analysis (The Shield): A system to detect suspicious patterns in job postings by looking for high-pressure language, unprofessional titles, missing information (like salary), and generic contact details.

The Outreach Toolkit (The Playbook): For jobs that passed the red flag checks, the tool would transform into a proactive assistant. It would help users "beat the resume robots" by extracting key hard and soft skills, analyzing the company's tone, and providing smart research links to empower them to build a superior application.

Building the Foundation
With the logic defined, we built the core architecture:

A modern React web application to serve as the project's home, featuring a clean landing page and the public "Flagged Jobs" archive.

The skeleton of a Chrome Extension, including the manifest.json, the popup UI, and the necessary scripts (content.js, background.js) to interact with job sites.

Current Status: An Intelligent, Interactive Sidebar
We have now implemented the full, enhanced logic within the extension's content.js file. The sidebar is no longer just a placeholder; it's an intelligent assistant that:

Performs a multi-faceted analysis of job postings.

Presents either detailed Red Flag warnings or a sophisticated Outreach Toolkit.

Includes a user-friendly, modal-based form for anonymously flagging suspicious jobs.

Is architected to check for and display high-priority alerts from the community archive.

We have successfully created the core user-facing experience of the JobScans extension, laying a powerful foundation for the final step: connecting it to our backend.
